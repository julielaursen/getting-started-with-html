 HTML Lesson 1 Notes: The Basics of the Web and HTML
</h1>
<p>
  The <b>World Wide Web</b> is made up of HTML documents. Word, PDF, images, videos, music and plain text can be displayed and linked to.  
<p>
  <b>HTTP</b> is the protocol that unites the web. HTTP makes requests to servers using your browsers. Browser types:
  <li> Firefox</li>
  <li> Internet Explorer</li>
  <li> Chrome </li>
</p>
<p> 
  <b>HTML</b> includes markup, which is made up of tags. Tags are structured with contents in between opening and closing tags. One tag is the <em>italicize</em> tag. If you leave a closing italicize(em) tag off <b>everything after the opening tag is <em>italicized</em></b> HTML attributes set a tag equal to a value in quotes and tags can have multiple attributes. <a href = "http://www.reddit.com"> This tag is a link to reddit </a> Image tags have no content and therefore don't need closing tags, these are void tags <br><img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt = "This image doesn't exist">
</p>
<p>
  <b>Web Applications</b> are any computer program that runs in a web browser.
